What tech does this project use?

This project uses `React`, `Next.js`, and `Zeit Now`.

I wanted to build something small using `Next.js`, in order to better understand how this React framework works,
what makes it easy to setup.

Why `Next.js`?
`Next.js` makes setting up a SSR React app incrediblly simple, without giving too much boilerplate.
- It works out of the box with and requires zero set up
- Automatic server rendering and code splitting
- Simply deployment
